                            Contract shall supersede any conflicting terms of other contracts which the Buyer may seek
                            to enforce against the Seller. In particular, any terms not directly aimed at bunker sales
                            transactions may not be enforced against the Seller to the effect they contravene the
                            Bunker Contract.
                            If a purchase of Bunker Oil is contracted for by a broker, an agent or a manager for a

                            liable for the payment of the delivery as Buyers. The Buyer warrants that it is
                            authorized as agent to order the Bunker Oil for delivery to the Vessel, and that the Seller has
                            a lien in the Vessel for its claim.
                            Any notice or any stamp in the Bunker Delivery Receipt or similar cannot waive the Seller’s
                            maritime lien on the Vessel.</p>

                            of Bunker Oil is suitable for the Vessel. The Bunker Oil shall be of the same quality generally
                            offered for sale at the time and place of delivery, for the grade of Bunker Oil ordered by the

                            The Buyer shall be responsible to keep the delivered Bunker Oil segregated from any Bunker
                            Oil(s) onboard the Vessel or from a different delivery to the Vessel. In no event shall the
                            Seller be responsible for the quality and compatibility of the Bunker Oil delivered if the
                            Seller’s product is mixed or comingled with any other product(s) onboard the receiving
                            Vessel. The Buyer shall be solely responsible for any losses caused by mixing or comingling
                            the Bunker Oil with any other oil, including any damage the Bunker Oil may cause on other
                            products on board the receiving vessel.
                            If the Bunker Oil deviates from specifications, the Buyer shall use all reasonable endeavors
                            to mitigate the consequences hereof and shall burn the Bunker Oil if possible even if this
                            requires employment of purification tools or other similar measures. The Seller shall cover
                            reasonable costs related hereto provided that the Seller is given opportunity to assist and

                            time for delivery. In the event the delivery is requested outside normal working hours or
                            normal working days and is permitted by local port regulations to be so delivered, the Buyer
                            shall pay all overtime and additional expenses incurred in connection therewith.
                            The Buyer shall be responsible for any and all demurrage, detention or additional expenses

                        <p>The Buyer shall pay for the Bunker Oil at the price agreed in the Confirmation as set forth in Seller’s invoice(s) (hereinafter the “Invoice”). In addition, the Buyer shall pay the costs of the delivery irrespective of whether the delivery takes place from a terminal facility, barge, lorry, or other method of delivery. The delivery costs shall be set forth in the Confirmation and/or in the invoice. Unless otherwise agreed, the final volume stated in Seller’s or its representative’s delivery documentation is to be considered final in respect of the quantity to be invoiced.
                            All prices are excluding VAT and/or taxes. The Seller is entitled, at any time, to charge additional VAT and/or taxes.
                            If not otherwise specifically agreed between Buyer and Seller at time of ordering, the confirmed costs including possible additional extra costs are only valid for delivery performed to the Vessel on the agreed and confirmed delivery date(s).

                            Payment shall be made in full, free of bank charges, without discount or deduction, and without set-off for any claim or counterclaim of any nature whatsoever.

                            In the event that any Invoice is not paid in due time, the Seller shall be entitled, at its sole discretion, to specify any particular Invoice or part thereof to which any subsequent payment(s) shall be applied, including, but not limited to, payment covering interest charges, legal fees and other charges. Moreover, the Buyer shall indemnify the Seller against any loss which is caused by adverse currency fluctuations between the Invoice currency and the value of the Danish Kroner from the latest due date of the Invoice until the date on which payment is made.

                            The Seller or its representatives shall arrange for samples to be drawn at the time of delivery of the Bunker Oil. Unless otherwise agreed between the Seller and Buyer prior to entering into the Bunker Contract, the samples shall be drawn from a point and in a manner chosen by the Seller or its representatives in accordance with the customary sampling procedures at the port or place of delivery of the Bunker Oil.
                            The sampling mentioned in paragraph 10.1 shall be performed in the presence of the Seller or its representatives and the Buyer or its representatives, but the absence of the Buyer or its representatives during all or any part of the sampling process shall not prejudice the validity of the samples.
                            On completion of sampling, all samples drawn by the Seller or its representatives are to be sealed, labeled and signed by both Seller or its representatives and Buyer or its representatives. One sample shall be retained by the Buyer or its representatives. The remaining samples shall be retained by the Seller or its representatives.
                            In the event of a dispute concerning the quality of the Bunker Oil, the results of analysis of the Seller’s or its representative’s drawn samples performed by an independent laboratory mutually appointed by the Buyer and Seller shall be conclusive to determine the quality of the Bunker Oil supplied. Analysis results of the Seller’s or its representative’s drawn samples will be the sole binding evidence for the quality of the Bunker Oil supplied to the Vessel.
                            If the Seller and the Buyer cannot agree on an independent laboratory to perform mutual analysis or if the Buyer fails to reply to the Seller’s notice hereof within 7 (seven) days from receipt of such notice, the Seller can at its sole discretion decide which laboratory to perform the analysis, which shall be final and binding for all parties involve.

Any claim regarding the quantity of the Bunker Oil delivered shall be notified verbally as well as in writing by the Buyer or the master of the Vessel to the Seller immediately during delivery of the Bunker Oil. In the event immediate verbal as well as written notice is not made, such claim shall be deemed to be waived and barred. A notification inserted in the Bunker Delivery Receipt or in a separate protest handed to the physical supplier of the Bunker Oil shall not qualify as notice under this section 11.1 and the Seller shall under no circumstances be deemed to have accepted such notice or protest handed to the physical supplier.
                            Any claim regarding the quality of the Bunker Oil delivered shall be presented in writing to the Seller as soon as an alleged problem has occurred or the Buyer is notified of any alleged problem and in any event no later than within 14 (fourteen) days from the date of delivery to the Vessel. Should the Buyer fail to make timely notification of any claim regarding the quality of the Bunker Oil the claim shall be deemed waived and barred.
                            In the event of any claim presented in accordance with Section 11.1 and 11.2, the Buyer shall:
                            • Cooperate with the Seller and make all necessary arrangements for the Seller or its representatives to investigate such claim, including but not limited to the boarding and inspection of the Vessel, the interviewing of crew, and the review and copying of Vessel documents.
